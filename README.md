***Travlex** is a third party Hotel Reservation System which aims at providing users a secure and easy platform to book hotels with little or no intervention on the part of the Hotel Administration. 
   Generally, softwares which provide similar facilities are often redundant and thus too time consuming. **Travlex** however is designed in a smarter way to lessen the time required by users to book
   hotels and also, reduce the hotel admin intervention to as little as possible. This is mainly achieved in two ways :*
   
  * Generation of tickets containing unique captcha that needs to be handed over to the concerned hotel's reception in person upon arrival to authenticate the User Booking
  * Automated room allocation and deallocation to customers as and when required.

***Signing Up** is a one time process and it's fairly simple. All you need to do is provide authentic credentials while signing up and finish the process in order to be registered as a user.
   Once you sign up, you would get redirected to the login page from where you could use the either your username or mobile number or email address to log in.*

*In case you forget your login credentials, an **OTP** would be sent to your email id (or a corresponding sms in case you provided your phone number) which when typed would redirect you to the change password screen where in you can reset your password.*

*Once you log in, you would be redirected to the booking page in **Release 0.1**(we are going to provide an user dashboard in **Release 0.1.1** to keep track of current bookings). After looking up and selecting the desired hotel and booking the required number of rooms, 
you get redirected to a page that generates a ticket containing the unique captcha.*

*The ticket containing the unique captcha, when handed over to the concerned hotel's reception in person upon arrival would authenticate the User Booking. Here is what a demo **ticket** would look like*
